# Hand-Gesture-Based-Painting
In this project, I have implemented the concepts of Computer Vision and with the help of Google's mediapipe library I have created a Hand Tracking Module which I have further used in creating the Hand Gesture based Painter.

To install the requirements use the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(MacOS and Linux users, replace pip with pip3)
